# Grocery Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and deriving insights from a grocery dataset using Python. 
Key steps:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing columns.
- Feature Engineering: Classifying products as sustainable vs non-sustainable.
- Data Analysis: Summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation checks.

## Steps
1. Cleaned the dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
2. Prepared the cleaned dataset for visualization in Power BI.

## Files
- `data/GroceryDataset.csv`: Original dataset.
- `data/cleaned_grocery_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset.
- `notebooks/Grocery Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with cleaning and analysis steps.

## Next Steps
The cleaned data will be used to build dashboards in Power BI.
